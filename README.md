# Space-tourism
Author:
  My name is Issayev Rakhat, I am student of IITU and future specialist of wherever I will choose to stay.
  
Challange:
  Challange was to make a website for familarization with space tourism company. Web site containe 4 pages, they are Homepage, Destination page, Crew page, Technology page. In every page was few more links to more pages. Basically saying, challenge was to create something decent using materials they delivered with knowledge and skill we have.
  
Why it was interesting: 
  This challange was very intriguing, because in the past i made only 1 website, which i am not satisfied of, so it was interesting to see how much i improved since my last attempt. I tried to implement as much transitions as i could, however to a beginner as i am it was not an easy task, so i made only one transition to work.:)
  
Problems in my way:
  Main problem was that, html and css markup of website was done by my pair Miras, design was from figma, so you must understand that every element here has it's own style and position is absolute. It was a hell of a job to implement a slider. As you know slider works like a window which shows only part of page which needs to be shown after clicking a button. To to set text and images into slider container I had to change every position to relative and change them. Also i had to search for places where links or naviagtion bar was covered by something so it didn't work. 
  Java Script was also a problem, because to be honest we did almost no practice related to web site making before, only super simple tasks, so i decided to search for solution in CodePen. However, i was dissaponted looking at this code where i wasn't able to understand nothing. My looking at code and experimenting, i did it and implemented slider which could seem little accomplishment, but that was big of a step for me.
